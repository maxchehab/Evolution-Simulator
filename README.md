# Evolution-Simulator
This is an example of a genetic algorithm that teaches a randomly creatd creatures how to walk. Over many testing periods creatures that perform subpar are removed from the gene pool while those that perform exceptionaly well create offspring with mutations similar to their parents. This process simulates evolution.
